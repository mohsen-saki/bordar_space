    "title": "Australia’s Economy: Resources and Energy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThis analysis is a historical overview of major industries in the Resources & Energy sectors. A story of how these sectors grew and evolved over the time and made a strong tie with Australia’s economy and politics, as well as the country’s geopolitics.\nInterrogating data over three decades from 1990 to 2020 indicates that Australia has exported more than 20 billion ton of refined and raw products which accounts for about 10% of the Australia’s Economy which is the second largest business sector after “Services”.\n \n Iron Ore and Coal are by far the two largest exported materials and right after them come Petroleum and Aluminium industries. Around 2010 with China’s economy emerging, Iron Ore overtook the Coal and just last year (2019-20), $102 billion worth of Iron Ore has left Australia’s shores. The same period export value for Coal, Petroleum, and Aluminium was $55, $59, and $13 billion respectively.\n \n The numbers reveal that Australia’s economy is highly dependent on fossil fuels and resources export. Just to pick one, Petroleum industries have shown such great growth from 2015-16 which overtook Coal export in 2019-20 for the first time in almost two decades.\n\n\nHas Australia Been Drifting Away From Manufacturing?\nSadly YES. Historical records show that Mining and Construction Businesses have grown year by year in a rate that both overtook Manufacturing as percent of GDP from 2010. An end to Australia’s iconic car manufacturer - Holden - is apparently the most publicly discussed case of Manufacturing bust.\n \n From almost 14% of GDP in 1990-91, Manufacturing has ended up to 5.5% in 2019-20. While in the same period, Mining Industries has boomed to about 9% from 4.5%. Construction and Services also kept their steady growth while Agriculture has shrunk to some extent.\nDespite its slow growth, Manufacturing has yet kept investors positive by standing slightly on top of the Construction with more than $21 billion income in year 2019-20.\n \n In context of having the Services sector (eg. Tourism, Education, Hospitality, etc) slashed by the Covid Pandemic, although many casted doubt on the Government’s recent plan for sustaining local Manufacturing, yet keeping up more resilient industries (eg. Manufacturing) seems a MUST without a shadow of doubt.\n\n\nChina: A Controversial Story\nWhen It comes to mining products, Australia’s export market is highly biased in favour of China. Although there are reasonable facts to justify it, the bare truth is Australia’s current situation; stuck in a geopolitical corner with China as tensions set to rise.\n \n Australia has exported more than $122 billion worth of Energy & Resources products to China in 2019-20 which stand for 54% of total export to major markets. Japan ranks second with $44 billion market value (20%). It may seem more interesting knowing that China’s share of the export market was 2% three decades ago and Japan was Australia’s number one export destination till 2010.\n \n However, although it seems both countries can not bear each other currently, the other end of this trade fight is China’s actual demand for Australian mining fruits. Iron Ore and Coal are by far the two largest export materials to China which both are key elements to steel production; the second largest industry in the world per se’. China’s recent act to put pressure on Australia’s Coal industry has been interpreted as an aggressive move, but probably in a long term view, they have to bear each other for a while to think over a way out of the tension with least damage to their nation’s economies.\n\n\nGREENs May Need to Set Expectations Low\nClimate and anti-fossil-fuel activists have a relatively strong voice in Australia. However, changes might happen slower than wishes. Resources and Energy, as the second largest industry in Australia has about a quarter of a million people directly employed. Although It is less than 2% of Australia’s workforce, however more than 80,000 are directly working in Coal, Oil, and Gas extraction industries alone. That apparently means it will take generations long to replace or shift these industries towards carbon-free solutions.\n \n Let social effects aside, obviously the main resistance to energy paradigm shift would be backed by the investors. Not simply because they benefit from it, but also because the income level is so high that mining $118 billion income in 2018-19 was almost as large as the whole Services sector income. It is not difficult to suppose that such a wealthy industry would have powerful allies in the parliament.\n \n Banking corporations concerned with public opinions, are announcing that they will stop lending to fossil fuel industries by a certain time in the future, but the fact is if there is only one industry that is not much dependent on the banks already, that would be the mining sector. In 2019, mining has borrowed $85 billion which stands for less than 3% of whole banks’ lending. In fact, finance and insurance businesses alone have borrowed almost $600 billion in the same period.\n \n And last but not the least, by having humankind hit by the Covid pandemic while everyone was so assured of the latest scientific breakthroughs and prospering economies all around the world, I personally expect governments to get more conservative with fast pace shifts in the economy. Especially Australia’s may seem more vulnerable to these kinds of disasters having a so-called modern economy which is basically relying on the Services Sector.\n\n\nPeople and States\nEnergy and Resources are a more complex matter when it is addressed at the state level. Surprisingly, Victoria’s involvement in the mining industry is almost negligible. It only plays a role in gold production and its share is 8% of Australia’s gold production.\n \n When it comes to coal mining, NSW and QLD own almost the whole industry each 44.5% and 54% respectively. And WA is probably wealthiest by controlling Australia’s whole Iron Ore industry. In fact, all VIC, SA, NT, and TAS together benefit from less than 2% of the whole mining industry.\n Remarks & Links\n\nData Source: Department of Industry and Science\nPowerBI Interactive Dashboard: PowerBI\nTableau Interactive Dashboard: Tableau\nGithub repo for this project including PBI templates & datasets: EconAussie\nTo try the Dashboard on desktop; Just download the template EconAussie.pbit & datasources from githup repo above and open with Desktop PowerBI."

    "title": "R.U.Stoked",
    "section": "",
    "text": "What about is this project?\nR.U.Stoked is a Natural Language Processing (Sentiment Analysis type), not a binary one though. Here I focused on detecting a third group of sentiment which I call here after “Disengaged”. A range of opinions which are neither “Stoked” nor “Dissatisfied”. I think detecting this group of so to speak “users/customers” can create business values in problem cases such as Churn or targeting prospect customers. Actually this idea is also kind of supported by the data. Almost exactly half of reviews rated 3 out of 5 recommended their experience to others and the other half suggested not to.\nView the project here on Github.\n\n\nWhere does data come from?\nThe data has been collected (/scraped) from SEEK website. It comprises almost 13k rows of data by which employees have expressed their feelings and opinions about their employers. I have just collected the data for a dozen of companies which have relatively had higher number of reviews. And They mostly belong to two fields of FMCG retailers and Finance/Technology industries.\n\n\nWhat are challenges?\n\nDetecting a neutral class of sentiment in between positive and negative ones has been a bit of challenge because exploring those reviews shows that the choice of words tends to be almost similar to either positive or negative reviews.\nMany of the reviews are written by not-native English speakers as they vary a lot in terms of word choices, sentence structures, comprehension, etc.\nThe SEEK template for registering reviews is asking for pros and cons. So, it has resulted in more of a list-like outcome rather than comprehensive opinions. For example in response to cons many may say “management” which clearly lacks the sentiment compared to something like “bad or poor management”.\nAnother feature of SEEK’s reviews is that the overall rating is not calculated as average of employees’ ratings on some other subjects but it is acquired independently. This raised a bit of inconsistency between users’ overall opinion of their client compared to their opinion on different aspects of their work paces.\n\n\n\nFirst try and failure\nThere is a folder named “withdrawn” in the repository which contains a few notebooks as my first approach to this project which I consider as a failure not particularly for the outcomes but more because of my strategy. I was sort of rushing to wrap it up which was not really working out and this is why: * I did not collect enough data in terms of both the amount of data and the meta-data which help to explore and explain data beter. * I did not tackle the problem according to the best practices. I created a pipeline of different models with various features and used the grid search technique to see which one results in the best accuracy score. I did not put much time into data exploration and feature engineering. As a result, It was more of a black box with no insight of what is going on under the hood of model performance.\n* I was not writing good codes. It was all in the notebooks (not reusable and well structured)\nHowever, I came across this excellent book “Building Machine Learning Powered Applications“ written by Emmanuel Ameisen. Reading this book is actually the reason to reconsider my approach and start this project over.\n\n\nToolings and Technologies\n\npandas to manipulate and explore the data\n\nmatplotlib and bokeh to visualise and explore the data\n\n\n\nTfifVectorizer and in some cases Spacy to get the word vectors.\n\nScikit-Learn RandomForestClassifier and Naive Bayes as model/algorithm\nstreamlit to build the application\nDocker and Github Actions for CI/CD\nHeroku and AWS to deploy on\n\n\n\nHow did it go?\n\nFirst model trained on just the text data has performed pretty well on predicting positive and negative classes but poorly on the “Disengaged” labels.\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nTo tweak the model performance, I extracted some features from the data and plugged them into the vectors. Those features were selected to help the model detecting the sentiment better and distinguishing different labels easier such as:\n\nWords great and good appear frequently in positive opinions\nWords poor, bad, not, etc. appear frequently in negative opinions\nThe count of above words appears to be an indication of sentiment in each piece of review.\nThe word but seems to have a higher frequency of occurring within “Disengaged” labels as it serves for changing the language tone from positive to negative or vice versa.\n\nPlugging above candidate features in the word vectors and visualization shows some improvement in separating data clusters each containing the majority of one of the labels but for the “Disengaged” label it still does not show much improvement:\n\nAnd the outcome scores agree as well:\n\nWell, I would say if features are too obvious, probably the model has already picked them. Using Naive Bayes algorithm as recommended by Scikit-Learn (Choosing the right estimator) did not make a noticeable difference as expected (Normally a data problem results should not change considerably just by changing algorithm, if so, probably something is done wrong).\nHowever, using just features without the word vectors shows some improvement albeit at cost of model performance decrease on two other labels.\n\nWorking more on generating and extracting features seems like a promising approach to take here.\n\n\nThe Application\nI have recently been hearing a lot about Streamlit and I wanted to try something new. Although it may not be as sophisticated as some backend frameworks such as Flask and Django, I should say that for prototyping and a simple single-page webapp, Streamlit was super easy, extremely quick, and very cool.\nRUStoked is live here!\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\n\n\nDeployment\nI went with a docker image as it is quite standard and straight forward. Deployment has been automated through GitHub Action to trigger some workflows on push and deploy to AWS ECS Instance and HEROKU, not at the same time though (Heroku server port is not to select and is generated as an environment variable which make some adjusments necessary to Dockerfile).\nObviously AWS required a lot more work around to get it orchestrating right and it is much stronger for providing this level of access to tweak the environment, however I love HEROKU for being simple and free :) as far as it is not consuming resources like a commercial webapp.\nAnyway, it is live here on heroku and here on AWS.\n\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWriting some unit tests and getting them to run through github actions.\nMore on model development focusing on extracting and generating features\nTrying neural net for same problem\n\nThanks to open source and free world."
